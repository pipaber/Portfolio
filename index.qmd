Hi! My name is Piero, and Iâ€™m a Biologist (with main formation in biotechnology) from Peru. I have specializations in data analysis and bioinformatics from Harvard University and MIT. Also, I love writing reproducible interactive reports using Quarto as a hobby.

Within my bioinformatic experience you can find RNA-Seq, Methyl-Seq, WGBS-Seq, Illumina Methylation Array and Multi-omics analyses. Also, I have experience on machine learning (OLS, ridge and lasso regression, SVM, Kernels, collaborative filtering, network analysis, high-dimensional reduction, etc) and deep learning models (Feed forward NN, Recurrent NN, Convolutional NN, Graph NN, Transformers, etc).
