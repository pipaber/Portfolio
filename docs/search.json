    "text": "The analysis of RNA-Seq data involves two distinct parts. The first one needs the use of servers or HPC (high performance computers) and has to do with quality control. pre-processing, alignment-mapping (usually with the STAR software) and counting (can be done using RSEM software). The second one is called downstream analysis and this part involves differential gene expression, gene sets analysis, etc. To see how to do the downstream analysis click here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork analysis of genes and ontologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethylated DNA between Cancer and Normal\n\n\n\n\n\nEpigenetics is the study of how your behaviors and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work. Unlike genetic changes, epigenetic changes are reversible and do not change your DNA sequence, but they can change how your body reads a DNA sequence (CDC,2024).

Also, I love writing reproducible interactive reports using Quarto as a hobby.\nWithin my bioinformatic experience you can find RNA-Seq, Methyl-Seq, WGBS-Seq, Illumina Methylation Array and Multi-omics analyses. Also, I have experience on machine learning (OLS, ridge and lasso regression, SVM, Kernels, collaborative filtering, network analysis, high-dimensional reduction, etc) and deep learning models (Feed forward NN, Recurrent NN, Convolutional NN, Graph NN, Transformers, etc)."
